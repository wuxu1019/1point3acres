"""
The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Example 1:

Input: buf = "abc", n = 4
Output: "abc"
Explanation: The actual number of characters read is 3, which is "abc".
Example 2:

Input: buf = "abcde", n = 5
Output: "abcde"
Note:
The read function will only be called once for each test case.
